Sinagios is a Sinatra app which provides an extremely basic RESTful API for
manipulating Nagios service and host downtime.

You can perform basically three operations:
 - GET /downtime (lists hosts and all current downtime IDs)
 - DELETE /downtime/:name (deletes all downtime for a host)
 - XXXX (will be used to schedule downtime for a host and its services)

A basic authkey authentication/authorisation system will be put in soon.
