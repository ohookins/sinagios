Sinagios is a Sinatra app which provides an extremely basic RESTful API for
manipulating Nagios service and host downtime.

You can perform basically three operations:
 - GET /v1/downtime (lists hosts and all current downtime IDs)
 - DELETE /v1/downtime/:name (deletes all downtime for a host)
 - POST /v1/downtime/:name (will be used to schedule downtime for a host and
                            its services)

As you can see, the API is versioned in case of future interface changes.

A basic authkey authentication/authorisation system may be put in, if it seems
useful and practical.
